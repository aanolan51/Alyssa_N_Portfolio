# Alyssa_N_Portfolio

## Description
This project was to build the structure of my portfolio website. This website will be used and updated as I build more tools and projects to showcase. This portfolio will be used as a foundation and enhanced over time. The main focus was learning how to place the different elements on the page, create the layout, get all in page links and external links working, and develop a responsive layout.

## Usage
This website is intended to be used as an interactive portfolio and resume. Contact information is provided, as well as links to upcoming projects and resume.
